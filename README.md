# Generative-Compression

- This is a Tensorflow implementation of the paper [Generative Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01467.pdf), a framework desinged to achieve image/video compression using generative adversarial networks (GANs).
- This is a term project for the Video Communication course I took in my senior year in the department of CSIE, National Taiwan University. The goal of this project is trying to improve the quality of the reconstructed images, so I did not strictly follow the original architecture and training details.
- Questions and discussions are welcome.
